# Breakdown Epic Pm

## Intent
Prompt for creating an Epic Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new epic. This PRD will be used as input for generating a technical architecture specification.

## Inputs
- User goal and expected deliverable
- Relevant repository context or existing artifacts
- Constraints (time, scope, quality, security/compliance)

## Workflow
1. Confirm scope and ask targeted clarifying questions when required.
2. Produce a concise, execution-ready plan focused on the stated goal.
3. Execute the domain-specific work implied by this skill's intent.
4. Validate quality, safety, and completeness before finalizing output.
5. Return concrete results with assumptions, decisions, and next actions.

## Output Contract
- Deliverables must be actionable, deterministic, and easy to review.
- Use clear sections and checklists when they improve execution clarity.
- Keep output concise while preserving all required decisions and risks.

## Guardrails
- Follow repository conventions and existing architecture boundaries.
- Do not expose secrets or sensitive data.
- Flag unresolved risks, dependencies, and follow-up work explicitly.
