# Web Design Reviewer

## Intent
This skill enables visual inspection of websites running locally or remotely to identify and fix design issues. Triggers on requests like "review website design", "check the UI", "fix the layout", "find design problems". Detects issues with responsive design, accessibility, visual consistency, and layout breakage, then performs fixes at the source code level.

## Inputs
- User goal and expected deliverable
- Relevant repository context or existing artifacts
- Constraints (time, scope, quality, security/compliance)

## Workflow
1. Confirm scope and ask targeted clarifying questions when required.
2. Produce a concise, execution-ready plan focused on the stated goal.
3. Execute the domain-specific work implied by this skill's intent.
4. Validate quality, safety, and completeness before finalizing output.
5. Return concrete results with assumptions, decisions, and next actions.

## Output Contract
- Deliverables must be actionable, deterministic, and easy to review.
- Use clear sections and checklists when they improve execution clarity.
- Keep output concise while preserving all required decisions and risks.

## Guardrails
- Follow repository conventions and existing architecture boundaries.
- Do not expose secrets or sensitive data.
- Flag unresolved risks, dependencies, and follow-up work explicitly.
